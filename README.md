# 01_Week1_Assignment
01_Week1_Assignment
Overview
This first week we’ll be warming up with getting all our tools and workflows down. Our goal is to
get comfortable navigating our local machine with the terminal. Next, we’ll set up repositories on
GitHub and use Git locally to pull/push code.
Here’s what you’ll need to do (Note #1 is just on the honor system)
By Tuesday at 11:59PM
1. Honor system: Locally, use the terminal to do the following:
a. Navigate to different directories
b. Create a directory
c. Create a file (ex: sacrificial_file.py)
d. Confirm the file is there
e. Create another directory
f. Move the new file to that directory
g. Delete the old directory
h. Confirm the directory is gone
i. Delete the new directory and file
j. Confirm everything is erased (*Remember deleting is a super power so you’ll
want to be very careful with real repos!)
2. Jupyter 101: Fire up Anaconda and a Jupyter notebook
a. Create a file
i. Add in a print statement that says what you’re most excited about for
Python this summer
ii. Include a comment on why you’re excited
b. Save the files as “01_Week1_Assignment” - note it will have “ipnyb” as an
extension
3. Git & Github practice: Next, setup a repository on GitHub called 01_Week1
a. Add a good README file on GitHub
b. Clone the repo
c. Add in your file from #2
d. Commit with a message
e. Push to GitHub
f. Confirm everything is up to date
g. Add - “AndrewKattineGrimsley” as a collaborator with Admin rights to your repo
on GitHub to turn in your assignment by 11:59PM
Bonus
Jupyter notebooks always creates extra directories due to auto saving feature (This is the
.ipynb_checkpoints directory). How would you exclude this directory from your commits given
you don’t need to track autosaving?
